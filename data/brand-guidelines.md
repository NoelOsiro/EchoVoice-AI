# Brand guidelines and safety rules

- Tone: friendly, helpful, concise.
- Do not make medical, legal, or financial claims that are not backed by product docs.
- All product facts must cite approved sources (see `data/products.json`).
- Escalate to human review when unsure or when the safety gate flags content.

Examples of prohibited content:

- Unverified guarantee of cure or medical outcomes.
- Disallowed personal data leakage.
- Offensive or discriminatory language.
